# Frappuccino: Coffee Shop Management System

## Overview

Frappuccino is a coffee shop management system built in Go with a PostgreSQL database backend. It allows users to manage orders, menu items, inventory, and provides detailed reporting and analytics. This project refactors an existing coffee shop system that previously used JSON-based storage to a scalable PostgreSQL relational database.

With this system, coffee shop managers and staff can efficiently track orders, manage ingredients, update menu items, and generate useful reports to improve business decisions.

## Features

- **Order Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and close orders.
- **Menu Management**: Add, update, and delete menu items.
- **Inventory Management**: Manage inventory levels and track ingredient usage.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on sales, popular items, and inventory leftovers.
- **Aggregation & Analytics**: Get aggregated data on ordered items, sales, and inventory trends.

- **Docker**: Required to run the application and PostgreSQL database in containers.
