Frappuccino: Coffee Shop Management System
Overview
Frappuccino is a coffee shop management system built in Go with a PostgreSQL database backend. It allows users to manage orders, menu items, inventory, and provides detailed reporting and analytics. This project refactors an existing coffee shop system that previously used JSON-based storage to a scalable PostgreSQL relational database.

With this system, coffee shop managers and staff can efficiently track orders, manage ingredients, update menu items, and generate useful reports to improve business decisions.

Features
Order Management: Create, retrieve, update, and close orders.

Menu Management: Add, update, and delete menu items.

Inventory Management: Manage inventory levels and track ingredient usage.

Reporting: Generate reports on sales, popular items, and inventory leftovers.

Aggregation & Analytics: Get aggregated data on ordered items, sales, and inventory trends.
